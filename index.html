            <h3>Welcome to My GitHub Page.</h3>

            <p>My interest for computers and programming started very early in life when my parents bought me a Sinclair ZX-90 X micro computer back when I was around 10-years-old. While most of my friends would be out and about playing soccer, hide-and-seek, and other games after school, I'd go home and spend all of my free hours teaching myself BASIC and learning how to create games and tools. Eventually I met other computer enthusiasts and we would get together every now and then to code whatever tickled our fancy.</p>
            <p>Though I really enjoyed programming, getting my hands on books, magazines, or anything that would allow me to grow turned out to be extremely difficult and I eventually pursued a career in the science field, leading up to a B.S in Biochemistry in 1997... and that would have been the end of that if it wasn't for a new friend I met in the Summer of 1996 (hey <strong>Vinny</strong>!!!) who rekindled my passion for all computer related topics!</p>
            <p>Here's a short list of some of my pet projects that were born out of my curiosity, need to scratch an itch or necessity for learning a new language. I list them here with the hope that some of it may be helpful to others some day:</p>
