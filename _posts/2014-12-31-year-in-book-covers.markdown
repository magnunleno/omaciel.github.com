For my last post of 2014 I wanted to show, with pictures, the books I
read and spent so much time with this year.

Back in January of 2014 I set out to read 30 books as part of my
[Reading Challenge][challenge]. I wanted to focus on reading Brazilian
authors early on as I felt that I really needed to learn more about
Brazilian literature and this time, read books for fun and not because
I was told to back when I was much younger.

I took advantage that **UNC** has a vast books collection with a very
decent section on Brazilian authors and I was able to read some really
awesome books by [Erico Verissimo][verissimo],
[Joaquim Manuel de Macedo][macedo], [José de Alencar][alencar],
[Jorge Amado][amado] and [Machado de Assis][assis]! I also fell in
love with these authors and the fact that it took me a couple of
decades to truly appreciate them doesn't bother me at all, since I
believe that it took me this long to reach the right maturity level...
in other words, I was not ready for them yet until this year.

I also fell in love with [John Steinbeck][steinbeck] and
[Ray Bradbury][bradbury], and I think that [Grapes of Wrath][wrath]
and [Dandelion Wine][dandelion] are two of the best books I have ever
read!

Lastly, 2014 was also the year I started reading short stories (to sample
different authors and see what they 'have to offer'), and I highly
recommend the short stories of [Flannery O'Connor][oconnor],
[John Cheever][cheever], [Simon Rich][rich], and
[Gabriel Garcí­a Márquez][gabriel].

In 2015 I plan to continue reading more Brazilian authors and
exploring different authors and genres! I may even re-read
[The Lord of the Rings][lotr] again. :)
