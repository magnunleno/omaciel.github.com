Took some time from my vacation and released **FauxFactory 0.3.0** to
make it **Python 3** compatible and to add a new **generate_utf8**
method (plus some nice tweaks and code clean up).

As always, the package is available on [Pypi][pypi] and can be installed via
**pip install fauxfactory**.

If you have any constructive feedback, suggestions, or file a bug
report or feature request, please use the [Github][fauxfactory] page.
