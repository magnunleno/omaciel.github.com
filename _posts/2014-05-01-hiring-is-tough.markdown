So I've been trying to hire two python developers to join my
automation team here at [Red Hat][redhat] since last
**November, 2013**... and believe it or not, so far I've had absolutely
zero success in finding good, strong, with real world experience
candidates in North Carolina! I either find really smart people, who
do have relevant backgrounds or could 'hit the ground running' but are
way out of my current budget, or they lack real world experience and
fall into more of an entry level position.

Basically I'm looking for someone who not only can 'speak python'
fluently but also has experience doing automation and writing tests,
as well as that 'QE mindset' that makes you want to automate all
things and question all things about a product! Someone who knows how
to file a good bug report and knows how to provide pertinent, relevant
information to developers so that they can fix a bug. Finally, someone
who believes in continuous integration and is excited about an
opportunity to improve and augment our existing testing
[framework][robottelo] and work with a very exciting product, knowing
that your contributions will affect literally thousands of customers
world wide!

Bonus points if you know what [Selenium][selenium] is and have played with
[Paramiko][paramiko] and/or [Requests][requests]!!!

Does that interest you? Feel that you got what I'm looking for? Then
take a peek at these two positions and apply fast!
