<p>This <strong>July 2015</strong> I travelled to the <strong>Red Hat</strong> office in <strong>Brno, Czech Republic</strong> to spend some time with my teammates there, and I managed to get a lot of reading done between long plane rides and being jet lagged for many nights :) So I finally managed to finish up ...</p>

<p>Those of you who know me know that I am a huge book reader and spend most of my free time reading several books at the same time. One could say that reading is one of my passions, and having wasted so many years after high school completely ignoring this passion (in exchange for spending most of my time trying to learn about <strong>Linux</strong>, get an education, a job and, let's be frank, chasing after girls), I decided that something had to be done about it, and starting around 2008 I 'forced' myself to dedicate at least one solid hour of reading <strong>for fun</strong> every day.</p>
<p>I find it funny to say that I had to <strong>force</strong> myself, but this statement is very much true. Being so used to spending all of my time sitting in front of a computer and getting flooded with information every single minute of the day (IRC, Twitter, Facebook, commit emails, RSS feeds, etc), I found it difficult to 'unplug' and spend time doing nothing but focusing on only one thing. I was so used to multitasking and being constantly bombarded with lots of information that sitting quietly and reading didn't feel very productive to me... sad but true.</p>
<p>Anyhow, after several 'agonizing' months of getting up from my desk and making a point of turning off my cel phone and finding a quiet place somewhere in the building (or at home during the weekends), I finally got into the habit of reading for pleasure. I actually looked forward to these reading periods (imagine that, huh?) and eventually I realized that if I skipped  this 'ritual' even one day, my days felt like they got longer and I felt stressed out and irritable for the remaining of the day. Reading became not only a good habit but my mechanism for relaxing and recharging my energies during the day!</p>
<p>Well, this passion and appetite for reading has only gotten bigger, and with time I have to say that it has become a pretty big part of who I am today! In a way I am happy that it took me this long to get back into the habit of reading... I mean, I feel that getting older was an important part of preparing myself so that I could really appreciate <a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;query=John+Steinbeck">John Steinbeck</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;query=Ray+Bradbury">Ray Bradbury</a> and the likes of them! Would I have truly appreciated <strong>The Grapes of Wrath</strong> when I was younger? Perhaps... but it took me around 40 years to get to it and I'm happy that when it did I was able to appreciate this amazing piece of art!</p>
<p>These last few months I decided that I wanted to start tracking all the books that I read, buy or receive as a gift every month (see my reading progress on <a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12048315-og-maciel">GoodReads</a> and add me as a friend), and jot down some of my impressions and motives for reading or buying them. Those familiar with <a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;query=Nick+Hornby">Nick Hornby</a> will probably associate this post (and hopefully others that will surely come) with the work he has done writing for the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.believermag.com/">Believer Magazine</a> ... and this would be correct. My intention is not to copy his style or anything like that, but I thought that the format he chose to report on his own reading 'adventures' would fit in quite nicely with what I wanted to get across to my readers... and I'm sticking with the format as long as it works for me :)</p>

read and spent so much time with this year.</p>

I wanted to focus on reading Brazilian authors early on as I felt that I
really needed to learn more about Brazilian literature and this time,
read books for fun and not because I was told to back when I was much
younger.</p>

                <div class="summary"><p>Making a quick pit stop to mark this milestone in my professional
career: today is my 3-year anniversary at Red Hat! Time has certainly
flown by and I really cannot believe that it has been three years since
I joined this company.</p>
<p>I know it is sort of cliche to say &quot;I can not believe that it has been
this long...&quot; and so on and so forth, but it is so true. Back then I
joined a relatively new project with very high ambitions, and the first
few months had me swimming way out in the deepest part of the pool,
trying to learn all 'Red Hat-things' and <strong>Clojure</strong> for the existing
automation framework (now we are fully using <strong>Python</strong>).</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>It was around 2005 when I started doing translations for Free and
Open-Source Software. Back then I was warmly welcomed to the Ubuntu
family and quickly learned all there was to know about using their
Rosetta online tool to translate and/or review existing translations for
the Brazilian Portuguese language. I spent so much time doing it, even
during working hours, that eventually I sort of &quot;made a name for myself&quot;
and made my way up to the upper layers of the Ubuntu Community echelon.</p>
<p>Then I &quot;graduated&quot; and started doing translations for the upstream
projects, such as GNOME, Xfce, LXDE, and Openbox. I took on more
responsabilities, learned to use Git and make commits for myself as well
as for other contributors, and strived to unify all Brazilian Portuguese
translations across as many different projects as possible. Many
discussions were had, (literally) hundreds of hours were spent going
though also hundreds of thoundands of translations for hundreds of
different applications, none of it bringing me any monetary of financial
advantage, but all done for the simple pleasure of knowing that I was
helping make FOSS applications &quot;speak&quot; Brazilian Portuguese.</p>
