If anyone wants to watch the live stream of Jono’s presentation in
Brazil, just point your favorite browser
`here <http://stream.softwarelivre.org:5000/babbage.ogg>`__. This is the
direct link to the stream, but if for whatever reason you end up
watching somebody else’s, try one of the other feeds from
`here <http://stream.softwarelivre.org:5000>`__. Clicking play will
launch your default media player, and clicking on the links in the
second column will attempt to open it in your browser.

Maybe Jono will perform his famous **dance**??? :)
