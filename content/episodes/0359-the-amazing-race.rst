The race is on to get Ubuntu Linux completely translated into other
languages.Ã‚Â  We, the `Brazilian Portuguese
Team <https://launchpad.net/people/ubuntu-l10n-pt-br>`__, are currently
in 5th “place”.

Inspired by the Ubuntu
`Classroom <https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Classroom>`__, I have taken the
iniciative to create 3 “classroom” sessions in portuguese (pt\_BR) to be
hosted starting today at the #ubuntu-br-tradutores channel @
Freenode.Ã‚Â  More information can be found in my
`announcement <http://blog.ogmaciel.com/?p=174>`__ (in portuguese),
including links to documentation on `how to use
IRC <http://wiki.ubuntubrasil.org/UsandoIRC>`__. :)

The topics covered in the 3 sessions will be:

-  What are Launchpad, Malone, and Rosetta?
-  How to create a GnuPG key
-  What is the Code of Conduct?
-  How to sign the Code of Conduct
-  List of terms (glossary) used during translations
-  How to use Rosetta
-  Best practices when translating

For the portuguese-speakingÃ‚Â  (not only brazilians) readers out there,
here’s the
`guideline <http://wiki.ubuntubrasil.org/DiaDoTradutor1Sessao>`__ we’ll
be following for today’s class.

Huge kudos do the `Brazilian Documentation
Team <http://wiki.ubuntubrasil.org/TimeDeDocumentacao>`__ for rising up
to my call of action!Ã‚Â  They’ve not only revamped the
`main <http://ubuntubrasil.org/>`__ site, but have also generated tons
(and I literally mean **tons**!) of excelente
`documentation <http://wiki.ubuntubrasil.org/Documentacao>`__!
