Lunch time here at `BarCampRDU <http://barcamp.org/BarCampRDU>`__, and
the food selection was AWESOME! We had a great variety of Mediterranean
food and it reminded me a lot of the food we have at the Mediterranean
Deli in Chapel Hill! Good opportunity to chit-chat and goof off,
specially if you happen to sit next to `devnet <http://lindox.org>`__!
