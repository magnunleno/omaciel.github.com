My good friend `Mario Ä?aniÄ‡ <http://pygi.wordpress.com/>`__ (pygi)
wrote a very interesting
`article <http://pygi.wordpress.com/2008/07/01/broken-by-birth/>`__ on
what he calls a “broken on birth” attitude towards DVCS adoption in many
open source groups. I was very intrigued as to how one would allow
different developers use their own (i.e. favorite) DVCS to work on their
project, and yet be able to pool everything together in order to release
a given set? If you want to learn about his ideas, about
`GitoriousKDE <http://techbase.kde.org/Projects/GitoriousKDE>`__ or have
some relevant feedback for him, drop him a line.
