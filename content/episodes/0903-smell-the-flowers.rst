I never really considered any of my photos to be anything out of the
ordinary (excluding those I take of my kids, off course :)Â  ), but the
one below came out pretty decent if you ask me.

|Seeing the flowers from the trees|

This was taken last Sunday at the `North Carolina Botanical
Garden <http://www.ncbg.unc.edu/>`__ in the best place to live in the
world, **Chapel Hill**, North Carolina. I’ve been using it as my
computer’s desktop wallpaper. Every time I see it, it makes me realize
how majestic Spring can be! If you liked it, download it
`here <http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2259/3535533219_489f3bf2a3_b_d.jpg>`__.

By the way, if you’re a student at my sister’s Yv class and were looking
for pictures of Yv (my daughter, named after my sister) and Kate, have
`fun <http://www.flickr.com/photos/ogmaciel>`__!
