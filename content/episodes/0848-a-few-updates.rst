-  `BillReminder <http://billreminder.gnulinuxbrasil.org/>`__ has
   attracted a new enthusiast who has brought a lot of interesting
   `ideas <http://groups.google.com/group/billreminder/t/14561b2323a90fec>`__
   to the `mailing
   list <http://groups.google.com/group/billreminder>`__. The coolest
   part is that we both share a lot of ideas in common and I have
   already started to write some code to pave the way to more reporting
   and some true home accounting features. |BillReminder with a smaller
   calendar and chart| After spending some time changing the charting
   module from the
   `hamster-applet <http://projecthamster.wordpress.com/>`__ project to
   do what I needed, I came to learn about a pretty cool project for
   graphing with Cairo and Python called
   `CairoPlot <http://linil.wordpress.com/2008/09/16/cairoplot-11/>`__!
