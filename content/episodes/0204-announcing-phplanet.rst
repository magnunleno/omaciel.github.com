It is with an enormous pleasure that I come to announce the birth of
`PhPlanet <http://sourceforge.net/projects/phplanet>`__, the first (if
I’m not mistaken) 100% Open Source blog agregator written by a Brazilian
for Brazilians! Using the `Planet <http://planetplanet.org/>`__ program
as source of inspiration,
`PhPlanet <http://sourceforge.net/projects/phplanet>`__ already shows
many new features such as:

Web based administration:

-  Add feeds (authors)
-  Approve feeds enrolled for the site
-  Modify authors’ information
-  Add, remove and/or edit Hackergotchis
-  Feeds (RSS and Atom)
-  Archiving of all posts for later retrieval (MySQL)
-  Registration of new feeds
-  Sending of posts via email (optional)…

|PhPlanet|

For a complete list of the all innovations, check the project’s `home
page <http://sourceforge.net/projects/phplanet>`__ and take a look at
the live `demo <http://home.meyer.eti.br/planet/>`__ page (sure, it is
written in portuguese but check out the functionality).

I had the priviledge of taking a peek at the source code and it is a
beauty! Congratulations for the excellent work MÃƒÂ¡rio!
