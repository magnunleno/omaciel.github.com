|Gtk# hacking|

Spent my lunch break doing (finally) some Gtk# / Mono hacking today. I
basically started porting a Window program I’ve been tinkering with to
remind me of my bills. So far it’s been a lot of fun! Hope to be able to
find more time and even spend some time on IRC to pick up a few tricks.
