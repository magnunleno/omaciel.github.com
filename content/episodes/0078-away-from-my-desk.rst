Starting today I will be stuck attending some training class for work.
These “classes” start at 9am and end at 4:30pm, all through Friday!
Hopefully I’ll get a chance to grab a cup of coffee in the next 5
minutes. Managed to update this blog to WordPress 1.5.1. Since this was
a bux-fixing release, don’t expect to find anything changed here.

As a side note, am looking forward to some
`WoW <http://www.worldofwarcraft.net>`__ playing time with Vinny
tonight! Go, `Ghost Force <http://www.ghost-force.net>`__, Go!
