What a great day to kick of the day! Just received my complimentary copy
of the book “\ `Django 1.1 Testing and
Debugging <http://bit.ly/DjangoTestingDebugBook>`__" from `Packt
Publishing <http://packtpub.com>`__! From the book’s overview page:

-  Develop Django applications quickly with fewer bugs through effective
   use of automated testing and debugging tools.
-  Ensure your code is accurate and stable throughout development and
   production by using Django’s test framework.
-  Understand the working of code and its generated output with the help
   of debugging tools.
-  Packed with detailed working examples that illustrate the techniques
   and tools for debugging.

I think I know what I’m doing this weekend! :) There’s a FREE
`chapter <https://www.packtpub.com/sites/default/files/7566_Django%201.1%20Testing%20and%20Debugging_SampleChapter_1.pdf>`__
you can download too to whet your appetite in case you’re interested.
