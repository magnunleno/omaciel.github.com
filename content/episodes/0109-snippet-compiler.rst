I often find myself creating a new .NET project every time I want to try
some simple piece of code, which is not only overkill sometimes but also
counter productive if you need to sift thorugh the different folders for
an specific piece of codeâ€¦ Even when you find it you end up having to
create yet another project to test it out. While discussing with a
friend about a very annoying Xml Serialization error I was getting at
work, I was pointed to `Snippet
Compiler <http://www.sliver.com/dotnet/SnippetCompiler/>`__ and a huge
weight was lifted off my shoulders! This application is awsome for it
basically allows you to run snippets (what else?) of .NET code without
ever creating projects and solutions! It has some other features such as
intellisense, etc, but the ability of just being able to test things
quickly is in my oppinion the best feature! Get yours today!
