So yesterday I `found
out <http://www.itweek.co.uk/vnunet/news/2156209/sun-support-ubuntu-linux>`__
that Sun will (finally) get on the Open Source wagon…Ã‚Â  I’ll refrain
from commenting on why I think they (Sun) have made this choice…Ã‚Â 
What I really want to know is:Ã‚Â  When will **Madobe**
(Macromedia+Adobe) wake up and smell the coffee???
