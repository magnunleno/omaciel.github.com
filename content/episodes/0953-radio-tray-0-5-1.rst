|Radio Tray|\ It is with great pleasure that I announce the
`release <http://linuxsoftware.blogsome.com/category/radio-tray/>`__ of
`Radio Tray <http://radiotray.sourceforge.net/>`__ **0.5.1**! I have
been following the development of this tiny streaming media player from
the very start and even cloned it so that I could play with it on
`BitBucket <http://bitbucket.org>`__. After a while I approached the
developer, `Carlos Ribeiro <http://linuxsoftware.blogsome.com>`__, and
asked him to take a look and all of the stuff I had done. I also
suggested that he starts using **Mercurial** instead of **Subversion**
to make easier for people to clone the code and submit patches in the
near future.

Well, he not only liked what I had done but also gave me commit access
to the project and moved the source code to a new mercurial repository!
I also registered the project on
`Transifex <http://www.transifex.net/projects/p/radiotray/>`__ to
facilitate the job of getting translations quickly and in less than 2
weeks we now have **Radio Tray** translated to **15 different
languages**!

It has been such a great pleasure working with Carlos these last 2
weeks! I have learned a lot of new things along the way and am really
looking forward to the next release! As always, you can expect to find
**Radio Tray** 0.5.1 in `Foresight Linux <http://foresightlinux.org>`__,
but Carlos has also made a deb file for those running â€˜buntu. :P
