If anyone is planning on attending this year’s `7º Fórum Internacional
Software Livre <http://fisl.softwarelivre.org/7.0/www/>`__, or **FISL**
for short, try to get a hold of `Mário
Meyer <https://launchpad.net/people/mariomeyer>`__ and Cia. at the
`Ubuntu Brazil <http://wiki.ubuntubrasil.org/>`__ booth! Tell him I have
asked him to show you a good time while you’re in Brazil, and I can
pretty much guarantee you’ll be speaking “fluent” portuguese in no time!
;) Too bad I can’t make it… That what you get for being a .NET
consultant I guess…
