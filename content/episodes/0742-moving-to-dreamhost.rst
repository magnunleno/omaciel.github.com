For more than 4 years I had been a happy customer of phpwebhosting.com.
That was until last year when my domain (shared) and the entire server
went down for no apparent reason! My emails were completely ignored and
to this day I don’t know what really happened.

This morning was the last straw for me. I have already signed a contract
with dreamhost and will be migrating my two blogs in the next few days.
So if you have a hard time getting through… hang on.
