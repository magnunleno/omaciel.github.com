Thanks to comments by **booxter** and `Patrick
Niedzielski <http://freesoftwarehacker.blogspot.com/>`__, I have added
support for 2 more languages to `Pylyglot <http://pylyglot.org>`__:
**Belarusian** and **Esperanto**! So far I had been adding languages
according to their translation percentage, starting from the top and
slowly moving down the list, but it probably makes sense to add some of
the languages that need a bit of help catching up with the other teams
and provide them with a means to check their standardization. So I’m
glad to welcome these two new “members” and kindly ask anyone who speaks
either one of these languages to lend a helping hand with their
translation by contacting their respective GNOME team coordinators:

-  `Esperanto <http://l10n.gnome.org/teams/eo>`__: **Jacob Nordfalk**
-  `Belarusian <http://l10n.gnome.org/teams/be>`__: **Ihar Hrachyshka**
