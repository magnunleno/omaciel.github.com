Once again I avoided mentioning about a very serious job lead I had with
the `University of North Carolina <http://www.unc.edu>`__ at the Chappel
Hill campus, afraid of jinxing myself. Well, today I have finally
recieved the final verdict after the 3-weeks long process: they decided
to go with a local candidate who had a slight advantage over me
(apparently some accounting and project management experience) and had
just lost her job. I confess I’m a bit disappointed at the moment for it
is the **fourth** position in a row I was genuinely interested that I
see slip through my fingers… I’m going to **try** to put a positive spin
on this and make myself believe that the best is yet to come… Kind of
hard to do when you think of the previous chances (Microsoft for
instance)… =/
