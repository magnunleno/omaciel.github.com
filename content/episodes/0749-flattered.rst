This last Thursday I was surprised by **Johan Dahlin** when he showed me
the new feature he’s adding to
`Stoq <http://www.stoq.com.br/index.php?lang=en>`__: colored coded
categories.

He said he was inspired by the same feature I added to
`BillReminder <http://billreminder.gnulinuxbrasil.org>`__. Wow! I
couldn’t help but feel very flattered with this… after all, **Stoq** is
a great piece of software developed by a very clever crew!
