Work has caught up to me and I have been flooded with small projects
here and there at work! I have received a great deal of feedback on how
to Ubuntunize my TabletPC and will be reporting on my progress as soon
as I get some time to breath.

|image0| In the meantime, while I away for yet another meeting, I just
want to thank `Sven Herzberg <http://herzi.eu/>`__ for
`writing <http://herzi.eu/index.php?/archives/82-Handwriting....html>`__
about `HRE
2.1.0 <http://www.blaubeermuffin.de/stuff/hre-2.1.0.tar.gz>`__
(`Website <http://gtt.blaubeermuffin.de/Handwriting_Recognition_Engine>`__).
I am very much looking forward to playing with it very soon!
