Quick series of small family related news. If you’re looking for tech
stuff, skip this post. :)

|Halloween (bright)|

Before flying to FossCamp, we carved a couple of small pumpkins in
preparation for Halloween. This will be baby Kate’s first Halloween and
it was also the first time I carved a pumpkin. Yv was very pleased with
the final result, specially when we turned off the lights and lit some
candles.

|Halloween (dark)|

Yv lost her first baby tooth and was very excited about the possibility
of being visited tonight by the `Tooth
Fairy <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth_fairy>`__! hehehe I never had
any of this growing up in Brazil, so I’m really enjoying this experience
and can’t wait to see her face tomorrow morning when she finds a US$1
coin under her pillow. :)

Tomorrow we’re taking the girls trick-or-treating around the
neighborhood. Yv thought of going as Foresight Linux (her design above)
but she finally changed her mind and will be as Wendy (Kate will be
Tinkerbell and my wife will go as `Peter
Pan <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan>`__). Me? Not sure yet… :)
