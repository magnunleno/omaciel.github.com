I’d like to second
`Davyd’s <http://davyd.livejournal.com/264221.html>`__ post about the
`10th Day of Remembrance <http://www.transgenderdor.org/>`__. It pains
me to know that even today with all the technological and intellectual
progress we’ve made, there are people out there who just cannot accept
and/or respect other people’s choices.

For those hiding behind a bible to defend their actions, maybe your god
should teach you more tolerance…

Yeah, comments will be turned off. I don’t plan to spend my day fending
off any comment that will tell me that their rights are more important
that somebody else’s.
