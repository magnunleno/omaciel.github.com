I was extremely pleased to see my application for the `GNOME
Foundation <http://foundation.gnome.org/>`__ approved. I have spent the
last 9 months working very closely with the localization teams, making
sure all work being done by the Ubuntu Brazilian team is submitted
upstream first for all GNOME packages! Iâ€™ve also been very vocal about a
unified Brazilian localization team, completely distro independent.

I want to thank all of those who put in a good word for me. Your support
is greatly appreciated! And thanks to all of those who opened up your
minds to the fact that no matter what distro you use, we all use the
same GNOME, KDE, etc.
