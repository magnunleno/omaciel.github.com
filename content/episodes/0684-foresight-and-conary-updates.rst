-  First off, for those participating of the `Google Highly Open
   Participation
   Contest <http://code.google.com/opensource/ghop/2007-8>`__, get your
   `GNOME Developer Kit
   now <http://live.gnome.org/GnomeDeveloperKit>`__!
   `Download <http://gnome.rpath.org/>`__ the VMWare image or the DVD
   and start hacking **today**! There will be continuous builds (the
   plan is to have them daily) so that you’ll always have the freshest
   GNOME code to play with. For the translators out there, I’ve
   recommended the inclusion of poEdit, intltool, translate-toolkit and
   gettext, all latest versions available. Feel free to let us
   `know <http://bugzilla.gnome.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=gnome-live>`__
   of any other application that could make your life easier.
-  To keep your `GNOME Developer
   Kit <http://live.gnome.org/GnomeDeveloperKit>`__ up to date, take
   advantage of the awesome `PackageKit <http://www.packagekit.org/>`__
   or for those interested in the amazing
   `Conary <http://wiki.rpath.com/wiki/Conary>`__ packaging and
   management system, run ***sudo conary updateall***
-  Speaking of Conary, those who have ventured into the packaging world
   will be happy with the release of conary
   `1.2.10 <http://blogs.conary.com/index.php/conarynews/2007/12/12/conary_1_2_10_released>`__
   and the new **cvc explain** command.

|Updating my system with PackageKit|

-  Have you tested the new `Foresight
   Linux <http://www.rpath.org/rbuilder/project/foresight/release?id=5928>`__
   (alpha 2) yet? My installation took 4 minutes, including formating a
   200GB HD. Been running it for a couple of weeks now and it’s pretty
   stable. Check out PackageKit updating it this evening.
