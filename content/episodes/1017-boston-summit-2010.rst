ï»¿Iâ€™m also coming to theÂ \ `**Boston**
**Summit** <http://live.gnome.org/Boston2010>`__ for the first time! I’m
looking forward to hanging out with my fellow Board members, meeting
some of them for the very first time. I’m also looking forward to
attending theÂ \ `Snowy
Hackfest <http://live.gnome.org/Hackfests/Snowy>`__ and other sessions
related to **GNOME 3.0**!

Think you can join us? Take a look at theÂ \ `GNOME Foundation blog for
