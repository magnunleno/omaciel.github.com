I don’t know how your work environment is, but where I work all the
engineers spend their entire days with their headphones glued to their
heads listening to music. Each one of us must own a couple of thousands
music files (all legal copies, I can assure you) in our laptops, and
since we all share our collections through the office, one could say
that we have a pretty decent online selection of music for all genres
and tastes. Still, there are times when you yearn for something new…
what to do?

During these times of despair (hehehe) there is nothing better than an
intelligent sistem for music recommendation, those sites that use funky
algorythms to recommend songs and artists based off your online
historical data and listening habits. The list below represents my own
recommendations for those who would like to experiment with this type of
system.

**Musicovery**:

I got this tip via this
`post <http://blog.vettalabs.com/2008/05/21/recomendando-musica-pela-web/>`__.
I found the recommendations fairly good, mas the visual display system
steals the show in my oppinion!

**Pandora**: `http://pandora.com <http://pandora.com>`__

The best of the all! Period!

|Pandora|

**Last.FM**: `http://www.last.fm <http://www.last.fm>`__

One of the very first of the bunch, with a recommendation system based
off the social network model, with lots of statistical information about
your weekly, monthly, etc listening habits.

|Last.fm|

**Radio Paradise**:

Ok, Radio Paradise is not a recommendation system but an online radio
station… but the variety of music they play is amazing!

**SomaFM**: `http://somafm.com <http://somafm.com>`__

Yet another online radio selection, with theme-based selections.

As you all can see, every day is a new musical adventure. :)
