    A `namber <http://mysteryrobot.com/>`__ is part name and part
    number. Each number between 0 and 255 has a namber. For example, 1
    is fun and 213 is star. A namber address is an internet address that
    uses nambers. For example, mysteryrobot.com’s namber is
    drum.start.orange.hope.mysteryrobot.com.

Here’s what my site came out:

    `www.ogmaciel.com <http://www.ogmaciel.com>`__ is
    `duck.bike.bank.dry.mysteryrobot.com <http://duck.bike.bank.dry.mysteryrobot.com/>`__
    Your address is bed.monkey.jump.best.mysteryrobot.com
    (12.145.122.16)
