One of my favorite web services ever
(`Open-Tran.eu <http://open-tran.blogspot.com>`__) announced today what
I consider to be the **best feature of 2008**! **PERIOD**! What am I
talking about? I’m talking about the possibilty of viewing the
comparison of how a single string was translated across several
projects! You have to experience it to understand how great this is! To
quote **Jacek Åšliwerski**, the brain behind this:

    I added new functionality to the service. Now you can compare the
    translations of phrases between the projects. Right now, the only
    way to see the comparison table is to enter an appropriate URL (or
    use the `API <http://open-tran.eu/RPC2>`__). Here is an example URL:

    -  `http://pt\_br.open-tran.eu/compare/zoom
       in <http://pt_br.open-tran.eu/compare/zoom%20in>`__

    If you follow it, you will see the table with suggestions grouped by
    the projects, so that you can see the differences between their
    translations.

If this doesn’t give you a fuzzy feeling (pun intended), I don’t know
what will!
