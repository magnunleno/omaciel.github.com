Yesterday’s news about the Suse Appliance Program had me grinning all
morning long… and I just had to forward what my co-worker
`wrote <http://www.smerpology.org/sprocket/article/1233/imitation>`__:

    Billy Marshall, CEO, rPath (2006): `The Standard OS is Virtually
    Gone <http://billyonopensource.blogspot.com/2006/10/standard-os-is-virtually-gone.html>`__
    Nat Friedman, CTO, Novell (2008): `The Standalone OS is
    Dead <http://www.internetnews.com/dev-news/article.php/3741476/Novell+The+Standalone+OS+is+Dead.htm>`__
    Indeed, weâ€™re flattered.

Yes, indeed!
