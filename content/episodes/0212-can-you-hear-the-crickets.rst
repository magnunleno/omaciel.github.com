Well, so far nobody who read this blog (contrary to the
`portuguese <http://blog.ogmaciel.com>`__ version) has signed up for the
Ubuntu Sweepstakes 2005! My other `blog <http://blog.ogmaciel.com>`__
seems to be fairing much better though and 3 people have officially
signed up! Maybe Iâ€™ve been spending way too much time handling the
Ubuntu translation and such, and not getting enough exposure among the
english-speaking folks?

On an unrelated note, I just learned a `new
way <http://primates.ximian.com/~federico/news-2005-12.html#07>`__ for
feeling relaxed all day long! ;)
