    `Gwibber <https://launchpad.net/gwibber>`__ is an open source
    microblogging client for GNOME developed with Python and GTK. It
    supports Twitter, Jaiku, Identi.ca, Facebook, and Digg.

I’ve been using Ping.FM to update my Twitter and Identi.ca accounts for
the last 2 weeks. That is all good and great but I needed a way to read
the replies and feeds from those 2 accounts as well! My “solution” was
to keep 3 tabs open in my browser and periodically refresh those pages
to see if there was anything new. In comes Gwibber. It wasn’t until last
night that I found out we had it packaged in our repositories (the
WebKit branch) so today I decided to give it a go.

So far it is updating me with the chatter from everyone I follow, which
is exactly what I wanted. I may post again about this tool in the coming
days to follow up.
