Just finished packaging
`poEdit <http://sourceforge.net/projects/poedit/>`__ and the
`translate-toolkit <http://translate.sourceforge.net/>`__ for
`Foresight <http://foresightlinux.com/>`__. I usually do my translations
using **Vim**, but ultimately use these two tools to “fine tune” them
before submiting them to bugzilla.

Speaking of translations, I cannot wait to see the new GNOME with
**100%** desktop translations in portuguese (Brazilian), thanks to a
partnership between the Brazilian
`GNOME <http://l10n.gnome.org/teams/pt_BR>`__ and
`Ubuntu <https://beta.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-l10n-pt-br>`__ translation
teams! ;)
