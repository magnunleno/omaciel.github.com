In order to promote the **GNOME 3.0** launch and spread the idea amongst
the GNOME community members, I’m sharing the following message! Please
**translate** it and **share** it with your friends and help us organize
the biggest GNOME Launch ever!

Dear GNOME friends,

The **GNOME.Asia** committee is working on making a big launch party
(whichÂ includes a **5 days hackfest**) to celebrate, promote and work
on the GNOMEÂ 3.0 release as part of our effort to promote GNOME in
Asia. Potential venues are in **India, Indonesia or Hong Kong**.

If you are also planning anything for the GNOME 3.0 launch, we
canÂ exchange ideas and make a bigger multi-cities launch party as well
as aÂ stronger marketing impact for the day of this big release
together!

A wiki page was created
atÂ \ `http://live.gnome.org/ThreePointZero/LaunchParty <http://live.gnome.org/ThreePointZero/LaunchParty>`__,
let’s link our GNOMEÂ 3.0 launch party page there. We welcome anybody
who is interested toÂ join and help us to make this event and global
launch party happen!

Regards, Pockey
