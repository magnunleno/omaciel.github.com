Early this week I decided to lure more people into participating more
with the task of translating Ubuntu Breezy’s packages to the Portuguese
(Brazilian) language. A quick email to our distribution
`BrazilianLoCo <mailto:%20ubuntu-br@lists.ubuntu.com>`__ list with
promises of eternal gratitude from $DEITY was able to attract a few
replies and by Tuesday (or was it Monday???) night I met up with a few
people at #ubuntu-br (Freenode) who were willing to spend some time
doing the job.

I must tell you… we were able to get a lot accomplished that night! And
the repercussion of that night seemed to have sent “after-shock” waves
across the community, for the effort is still ongoing and more people
joined in the effort!

I just have got to mention `Bruno
Lima <https://launchpad.net/people/bslima19>`__ and `MÃƒÂ¡rio
Meyer <https://launchpad.net/people/mariomeyer>`__, two great guys who
are responsible for doing a whole lot of work in such a short time AND
attract more people to the cause!

Looking forward to continue working with you and beat you in our little
translation race! ;)
