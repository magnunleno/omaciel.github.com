It’s been another crazy/hectic week for me at work, so blogging and
pretty much all other activities had to take the back seat.

One important piece of news is that I have been
`elected <http://foundation.gnome.org/vote/results.php?election_id=14>`__
to the **GNOME Foundation Board of Directors** together with other 6
members! Thank you all of you who voted for me! I intent to devote a
bigger chunk of my time to be a proactive, hands on and very vocal
member of this group and will strive to blog about my experience as much
as I can!

Next week should be just as crazy as the last 2 but I will try to blog
at least once to let people know what’s going on in my neck of the
woods!
