… and today, chatting online with `André
Noel <http://andrenoel.com.br>`__, I remembered that I was at **Linux
World Expo** in **Boston**, MA representing Ubuntu! I had my “15 seconds
of fame” when I was `interviewed <http://www.lulu.tv/?p=733>`__ by the
guys from `Lulu.tv <http://www.lulu.tv>`__.

Those were 3 great days that I’ll never forget…
