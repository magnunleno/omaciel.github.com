This monthâ€™s `Northern NJ Linux MeetUp <http://linux.meetup.com/8/>`__
meeting had the highest attendance so far since I became the organizer:
7, including myself and our guest speaker
`Mako <http://mako.yukidoke.org/>`__. He was kind enough to accept my
invitation to visit and tell us about his work with Ubuntu and Debian
Linux. I think everyone had a good time! Mako seems to be a really nice
guy and was more than willing to answer our questions. At the end of the
night I drove him back across the G.W. Bridge and extended an invitation
for a repeat in the near future.
