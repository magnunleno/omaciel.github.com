For someone who has run his own `podcast`_ for several years (albeit
not generating a lot of content lately), it took me quite some time to
actually start *listening* to podcasts myself. Ironic, I know, but I
guess the main reason behind this was because I was always reading
code at work and eventually, no matter how hard I tried, I just
couldn't pay attention to what was being said! No matter how
interesting the topic being discussed was or how engaging the hosts
(or hosts) were, my brain would be so focused on reading code that
everything else just turned into white noise.

Well, fast forward a couple of years and I still am reading code
(though not as much as I used to due to a new role), and I still have
a hard time listening to podcast while at work... so I decided to only
listen to them when I was **not** working. Simple, right? But it took
me a while to change that for some reason.

Anyhow, I now listen to podcasts while driving (which I don't really
do a lot of since I work from home 99.99% of the time) or when I go
for walks, and after a while I have started following a handful of
them which are now part of my weekly routine:

* `All The Books`_ which provide me with an up to date list of
  suggestions for what books to read next. They're pretty regular with
  their episodes, so I can always count on listening about new books
  pretty much every week.
* `Book Riot`_ for another dose of more news about books!
* `Hack the Entrepreneur`_ to keep up with people who are making
  something about what they are passionate about.
* `Wonderland Podcast`_ which I only started listening to a few weeks
  back but it has turned into one of my favorite.
* `Science Vs`_ another new addition to my list, with entertaining
  takes at interesting topics such as 'the G-spot', 'Fracking', 'Gun
  Control' and 'Organic Food'.

Today I was introduced to `Invisibilia`_ and though I only listened to
the first 10 minutes (I was giving the link during working hours, so
no go for me), I'm already very interested and will follow it.

I do have other podcasts that I am still subscribed to, but these
listed here are the ones that I am still following every episode.
Maybe if I had to drive to work every day or went for walks more
often, maybe then I would listen to more podcasts? Trust me though, I
rather continue listening to only a small set of them than drive to
work every day. Don't get me wrong, I **love** going to work, but
that's 2 hours/day of my life that I rather spend at home :)

How about you? What podcasts do you find yourself going back to every
time a new episode is published? Would you mind sharing your
suggestions (and why you like the podcasts) with me here?
