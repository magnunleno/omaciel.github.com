Release soon, release often they say, right? Well, here it is then!

Today I released version “7 Different Types of Smoke” (beta) 0.1 of my
pet project `BillReminder <http://billreminder.sourceforge.net/>`__.
Born out my need for a simple and light home accounting desktop
application, BillReminder became my favorite hobbie and main learning
entrance into the python world for me!

Though still in beta, this version includes an attempt at a smart
database layer (built on top of sqlite) which should allow the
application to expand its capabilities of saving different types of
data. It also has a simple notification system that will remind you
every day of your outstanding bills, independent if you’re running the
application or not. Also noteworthy is the availability of translations
in Swedish (thanks Daniel) and Brazilian Portuguese by yours truly.

This beta release was possible thanks to the usual suspects (except for
Mat who just recently started helping me test the application):

-  Laudeci Oliveira
-  Luiz Armesto
-  Daniel Nylander
-  Giovanni Deganni
-  Ruivaldo
-  Mario Danic
-  Led Style
-  Vinicius Depizzol
-  Mat Davey

Bugs, comments, help (yes!!!) welcome!
