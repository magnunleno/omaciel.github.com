Kinda scary when you can relate your job to a
`movie <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0151804/>`__:

    **BOB SLYDELL** Y’see, what we’re trying to do here, we’re just
    trying to get a feel for how people spend their day. So, if you
    would, would you just walk us through a typical day for you?
    **PETER**
     Yeah.
    **BOB SLYDELL**
     Great.
    **PETER**
     Well, I generally come in at least fifteen minutes late. I use the
    side door, that way Lumbergh can’t see me. Uh, and after that, I
    just sorta space out for about an hour.
    **BOB PORTER**
     Space out?
    **PETER**
     Yeah. I just stare at my desk but it looks like I’m working. I do
    that for probably another hour after lunch too. I’d probably, say,
    in a given week, I probably do about fifteen minutes of real, actual
    work.
