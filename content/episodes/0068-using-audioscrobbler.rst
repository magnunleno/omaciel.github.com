`posts <http://triplehelix.org/blog/2005/04/28/plug-audioscrobbler/>`__
of people talking about
`Audioscrobbler <http://www.audioscrobbler.com>`__ today and decided to
see what the noise was all about.

    Audioscrobbler builds a profile of your musical taste using a plugin
    for your media player (Winamp, iTunes,
    `XMMS <http://www.xmms.org/>`__,
    `foobar2000 <http://www.foobar2000.org/>`__, etc..). Plugins send
    the name of every song you play to the Audioscrobbler server, which
    updates your musical profile with the new song. Every person with a
    plugin has their own page on this site which shows their listening
    statistics. The system automatically matches you to people with a
    similar music taste, and generates personalised recommendations.

Note that `XMMS <http://www.xmms.org/>`__ and
`foobar2000 <http://www.foobar2000.org/>`__ are both supported! :)

If anyone wants to check what Iâ€™ve been listening to while at work (or
my prefered coding music), just click
