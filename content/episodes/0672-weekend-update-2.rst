A couple of updates before heading out to the weekend:

Been working hard together with `FÃƒÂ¡bio
Nogueira <http://blog.ubuntuser.com.br>`__ on the
`XFCE <http://www.xfce.org/>`__ translations before the eminent
**4.4.2** release. Things are looking
`really <http://i18n.xfce.org/wiki/team_pt_br>`__ good!

Tonight I was feeling a bit adventurous and took the pre-alpha
`Foresight <http://www.foresightlinux.org>`__ 2.0 KDE Edition and
installed it at home. Like I said, I was really feeling adventurous and
installed the **x86\_64** bit version too, and so far everything looks
good! **Amarok** feels really good right now! :) The whole idea is to
allow me to work on **Brazilian Portuguese** translations for
`KDE <http://www.kde.org/>`__ and be able to see my work in use.

Speaking of translations, I want to thank the good folks at
`Maemo <http://maemo.org/>`__ for accepting my application for the
`N810 <http://nokia.com/n810>`__. Look for some Brazilian Portuguese
goodness coming your way soon… :)

Look out for the official
`announcement <http://www.foresightlinux.org/releases/2-alpha-1/>`__ and
directions on how to get your hands on a **Foresight 2.0 Alpha DVD GNOME
Edition**! Full installation time seems to be at around **5-7 minutes**!
My KDE install took 4 minutes! Blink and you may miss it! :P

I feel like I’m forgetting something but can’t remember right now… Oh
wait! Yes! Does anyone know if it is possible to use Mugshot in
conjunction with Amarok? I mean, this application really rocks!
