No, I did not get hired to work for `Pixar <http://www.pixar.com/>`__.
[sigh] I just wanted to point you to
`this <http://aintitcool.com/display.cgi?id=19658#1>`__ interesting
article describing the working environment there.

    A lot of the animators decided early on that they didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want
    cubicles, so instead, Pixar found these groovy little cottages that
    they bought for them. Walking through the animation department is
    like walking through a neighborhood for dwarves. Lots of little
    houses laid out along Ã¢â‚¬Å“streets,Ã¢â‚¬Â? each one with an
    address on the door.

It reminds me of all the places I’ve worked for in the past… :)
