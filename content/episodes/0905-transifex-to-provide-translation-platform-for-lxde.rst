The `LXDE <http://lxde.org>`__ project has announced that it will use
the `Transifex <http://www.transifex.org/>`__ platform to allow their
users to better manage their workflow, provide up to the minute data and
statistics, and lower their administrative workload. The full
announcement can be found `here <http://blog.lxde.org/?p=336>`__.

It was a real pleasure to work along side **Martin Bagge, Mario Behling,
Dimitris Glezos, Diego BÃºrigo ZacarÃ£o and Ignacio Vazquez-Abrams** and
get this partnership in place. Expect a lot of good things coming from
both projects!
