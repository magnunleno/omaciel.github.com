Been quite busy at work these days, as well as playing the host to my
parents during the holidays. I did keep up with what was happening
around the world, thanks to my G1 (I love this gadget!), and wanted to
share a few nice nuggets.

-  First of all, the birth of
   `Lotte <http://blog.transifex.net/2009/05/introducing-lotte/>`__, the
   online translation editor! This new feature will help the
   `Transifex <http://www.transifex.org>`__ guys deliver a fatal 1,2
   punch combination in the fight against bad translation tools and
   processes!

-  As if Dimitris and his crew didn’t have enough on their plate (I tell
   you, they have macchiato running through their veins), a new
   fledgling `web portal <http://www.transifex.net>`__ portal for
   translators is in the makings. Think of a place where translators can
   offers their skills to projects in need of translators and you can
   see where this could lead.
-  Still speaking of translations, hanging out on #transifex on Freenode
   I picked up that the
   `Mercurial <http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/>`__ guys really
   like Transifex and what it has to offer their current legion of
   translators! Sounds like some experimenting may take place soon
   between these 2 projects (I’ll keep my fingers crossed!).
-  On a different subject, I have started working on a **Snowy
   Appliance** yesterday and will have something done and consumable by
   this weekend. Don’t know what `snowy <http://live.gnome.org/Snowy>`__
   is? Then check **Paul Cutler**'s blog
   `post <http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/silwenae/~3/83IvWoG-rUM/>`__
   and the links within it. Want to lend me a hand? Ping me on IRC,
   email, comment here, `Twitter <http://www.twitter.com/OgMaciel>`__,
   etc, etc.
-  I’m running this year for the `GNOME Board of
   Directors <http://foundation.gnome.org/elections/overview.html>`__!
   Take a look at the `list of
   candidates <http://mail.gnome.org/archives/foundation-list/2009-May/msg00037.html>`__
   and if you’re a **GNOME Foundation** member, remember to vote! If
   you’re not a member, what are you waiting for?
-  My **35th** birthday is fast approaching (June 8th actually) and I
   will be updating my
   `wishlist <http://www.amazon.com/wishlist/32BX7VP2GEFI1>`__ juuuuust
   in case someone feels like surprising me, *hint hint*
