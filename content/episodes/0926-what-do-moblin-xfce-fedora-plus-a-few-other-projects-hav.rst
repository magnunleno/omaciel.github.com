Just to follow up on one of my earlier messages to
`Twitter <http://twitter.com/OgMaciel>`__/`Identi.ca <http://identi.ca/ogmaciel>`__
today, here’s a little trivia for you:

    "What do `Moblin <http://translate.moblin.org>`__,
    `Xfce <https://translations.xfce.org/>`__,
    `Fedora <https://translate.fedoraproject.org/>`__ plus a few other
    projects have in common? They all use
    `Transifex <http://transifex.org>`__ for their translations!”

There’s quite a **few other projects** out there already toying with
`Transifex <http://transifex.org/>`__ to see if it fits their needs too,
which goes to show that the word is getting out about the benefits of
using it as a platform for managing translations. I, for one, am very
excited to see all the hard work being poured into it coming to
fruition! It definitely validates their vision and it definitely must
feel really good to work for `Indifex <http://indifex.com/>`__, the
startup behind Transifex!

I also noticed that my `Transifex
Appliance <http://www.rpath.org/web/project/transifex/>`__ project seems
to be generating some traffic too, which leads me to believe that people
are downloading it (or launching it on **Amazon’s AWS**) to test drive
it without the need of installing all of the moving pieces that are
needed to get your environment up and running. For the **last 30 days**
the appliance has been **downloaded 421 times**, enough traffic to get
it listed in the **Most Popular** section of `rBuilder
Online <http://www.rpath.org/web/>`__!

Shortly before moving to my own house a couple of weeks ago, I started
creating a separate “flavor” of the `Transifex
Appliance <http://www.rpath.org/web/project/transifex/>`__ project, this
time based on the **CentOS** (powered by
`Conary <http://wiki.rpath.com/wiki/Conary>`__, off course!) platform,
but trying to unpack our stuff in the new place together with some
pretty tight deadlines at work has limited how much time I can dedicate
to this enterprise right now. Chances are that soon after
**Thanksgiving** I may get enough free time to get a `CentOS-based
Transifex
Appliance <http://www.rpath.org/web/project/transifexcentos/>`__ off the
ground!
