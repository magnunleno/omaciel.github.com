After the first shock-wave caused by the announcement of `Google
Talk <http://www.google.com/talk/>`__ and the lack of a client for
non-Microsoft operating systems, I’m glad to inform that you’ll be able
to join in the fun using some of the other supported open source
clients. Since I use `Gaim <http://gaim.sourceforge.net/>`__ for all my
instant messenger needs,
`here <http://www.google.com/support/talk/bin/answer.py?answer=24073>`__'s
the info on how to set it up.
