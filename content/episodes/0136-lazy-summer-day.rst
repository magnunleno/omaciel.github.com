Spent a uneventful and quiet day with my dad. Played a bit of tennis in
the park and had BBQ for lunch. Got an email from a
`friend <http://www.kaegisllc.com>`__ who got free wi-fi while on the
beach in Atlantic City. Bastard! :) Iâ€™m still a bit sore but managed to
catch some quality Zs last night. My younger sister is in town so it
should be a fun weekend.
