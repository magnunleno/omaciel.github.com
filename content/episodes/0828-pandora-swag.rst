Today I received a mysterious package in the mail. Turns out it was some
swag from `Pandora <http://pandora.com>`__: a hat and some stickers.

You know what the best part was? Not the cool hat or stickers, but the
letter that accompanied the items in the envelope. It was actually
manually signed (i.e. not a print out) by **Lucia Willow**, Community
Manager, and **Tim Westergren**, Founder. It is the kind of attention to
details that makes a huge difference!
