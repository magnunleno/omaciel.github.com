About today’s
`outburst <http://www.murrayc.com/blog/permalink/2007/11/26/gnome-board-2007-candidates-the-bad/>`__,
I have the following to say: The **GNOME Foundation** has established a
democratic process by which its members and directions can be chosen. If
a process or person has not delivered that which was agreed upon or
expected (due to a role), that is the price one pays for democracy.
Please, let us not lose out cool and take advantage of the system to do
what is right for the Foundation. By all means, voice your opinion… but
let us all keep our cool.

 

    "Democracy arose from men’s thinking that if they are equal in any
    respect, they are equal absolutely."
    `Aristotle <http://en.proverbia.net/citasautor.asp?autor=10254>`__
    *(384 BC-322 BC) Greek philosopher.*

**UPDATE:** I’d like to join those

`3 <http://blogs.gnome.org/mortenw/2007/11/26/murray-a-retraction-is-in-order/>`__)
who are kindly asking Murray to retract his comments and use this year’s
elections to really voice his opinion.
