#. `Coffee, a personal history <http://../?p=976>`__

      to split the XML-like file that **WordPress** generates when you
      use the **Export** feature. Tonight I have finally added the final
      touches […]

#. `A Hamster, a Lynx and The Princess Brideâ€¦
   What??? <http://../?p=1004>`__

   -  Got a couple of interesting bits for you today, starting with some
      really great news from the `Hamster
      Project <http://projecthamster.wordpress.com/about/>`__, a time
      tracking application. My friend **Tom** wrote about his recent
