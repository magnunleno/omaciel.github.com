Another gem from `Piled Higher and Deeper <http://www.phdcomics.com>`__
comic! It reminded me of my last job interview… Right before I was
interviewed by “the boss” I asked to use the restroom. “Sure,” he said.
“I also need to go.” So there we were standing side by side making small
talk… Now THAT was awkward!
