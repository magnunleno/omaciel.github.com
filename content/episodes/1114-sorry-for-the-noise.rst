|Sorry|\ I’ve just recently started migrating my blog to
`Tumblr <http://ogmaciel.tumblr.com>`__, and in the process of importing
my archives from **WordPress** I seem to have caused some issues with
certain aggregators that are now **picking up posts from 2007**\ …
Yesterday I also triggered a massive torrent on both **Twitter** and
**Facebook**\ …

Please accept my apologies for the incovenience… more on the Tumblr
migration to follow!
