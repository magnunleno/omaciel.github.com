I was extremely thrilled to learn that my good friend **Pete
Savage**\ `decided <http://emblemdivide.wordpress.com/2009/10/28/emblem-divide-for-charity/>`__
to publish his novel “\ `Emblem
Divide <http://emblemdivide.wordpress.com>`__" online! I had the honor
of getting a copy of his work last month and have enjoyed reading it a
lot!

The novel will be available completely **free of charge**, no strings
attached! To top it off, being the nice guy that he is, he’s also
setting up a donation system to take advantage of the traffic that his
web site will most like generate so that you can support a charity of
your choice! More details on that will be available soon from his site,
but feel free to recommend a charity to him directly via a comment.
