Following the trend of computer companies shipping GNU/Linux
pre-installed hardware, `Shuttle <http://us.shuttle.com/>`__ announced
yesterday that they too will ship their XPC model with `Foresight
GNU/Linux <http://www.foresightlinux.org>`__! The official release note
can be read `here <http://us.shuttle.com/news.aspx>`__, as well as some
provocative `comments <http://techreport.com/discussions.x/14278>`__ on
the reason why they chose this “\ `little
known <http://www.tuxmachines.org/node/24781>`__" distribution.

Having seen one of these boxes up and close already, it was fairly cool
to see a system that just works out of the box. Since they have control
over the hardware they ship, every single feature, including compiz just
works!

It used to be that when you went to buy a computer system at a store,
you chose something based on how much RAM, hard drive space, etc it came
with… not the **operating system**! Add another notch to the power of
choice!
