Been spending some quality hacking time these last few days, basically
re-writting my tentative Rss reader application. The first 2 iterations
relied on the `Rss.NET <http://rss-net.sourceforge.net/>`__ code library
but after hitting some major obstacles I sort of “left it by the side of
the road” while I re-grouped my ideas. Last week I finally gathered
enough ideas to go back to “production.” I decided to hack away at the
`Rss.NET <http://rss-net.sourceforge.net/>`__ library and turn it into a
smaller, lean, and meaner piece of code. With that said, I have spent
every precious little free time I get working on the new version. At
first I thought I’d call it RssReader.NET but am now toying with the new
name of WickedReader… Suggestions are welcome!

The old, initial application:

|RssReader.NET|

The new, re-written application:

|WickedReader|
