Finally caught up with my rss feeds and found out about some new
`sexyness <http://d.minuslab.net/?p=65>`__ coming up in
`Openbox <http://icculus.org/openbox/index.php/Main_Page>`__. You’ll
need to get Openbox(\ `git <http://d.minuslab.net/?p=65>`__) and
Obconf(\ `git <http://d.minuslab.net/?p=68>`__) from their respective
git repositories as well as
`this <http://d.minuslab.net/files/hmmxp.tar.gz>`__ theme.

|Newer Openbox (testing) goodness running on Foresight|

If you’re running Foresight and want to try this (since it is still in
development, I didn’t bother to submit it to a repo yet), let me know
and I’ll get you the changeset.
