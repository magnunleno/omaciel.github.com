For my last post of 2014 I wanted to show, with pictures, the books I
read and spent so much time with this year.

Back in January of 2014 I set out to read 30 books as part of my
`Reading
Challenge <https://www.goodreads.com/challenges/1914-2014-reading-challenge>`__.
I wanted to focus on reading Brazilian authors early on as I felt that I
really needed to learn more about Brazilian literature and this time,
read books for fun and not because I was told to back when I was much
younger.

I took advantage that **UNC** has a vast books collection with a very
decent section on Brazilian authors and I was able to read some really
awesome books by `Erico
Verissimo <https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3376364.Erico_Verissimo>`__,
`Joaquim Manuel de
Macedo <https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/191653.Joaquim_Manuel_de_Macedo>`__,
`José de
Alencar <https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/540628.Jos_de_Alencar>`__,
`Jorge
Amado <https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/52683.Jorge_Amado>`__ and
`Machado de
Assis <https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/22458.Machado_de_Assis>`__!
I also fell in love with these authors and the fact that it took me a
couple of decades to truly appreciate them doesn't bother me at all,
since I believe that it took me this long to reach the right maturity
level... in other words, I was not ready for them yet until this year.

I also fell in love with `John
Steinbeck <https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/585.John_Steinbeck>`__
and `Ray
Bradbury <https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1630.Ray_Bradbury>`__,
and I think that `Grapes of
Wrath <https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18114322-the-grapes-of-wrath>`__
and `Dandelion
Wine <https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50033.Dandelion_Wine>`__ are
two of the best books I have ever read!

Lastly, 2014 was also the year I started reading short stories (to
sample different authors and see what they 'have to offer'), and I
highly recommend the short stories of `Flannery
O'Connor <https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/22694.Flannery_O_Connor>`__,
`John
Cheever <https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7464.John_Cheever>`__,
`Simon
Rich <https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/158635.Simon_Rich>`__, and
`Gabriel Garcí­a
Márquez <https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/13450.Gabriel_Garc_a_M_rquez>`__.

In 2015 I plan to continue reading more Brazilian authors and exploring
different authors and genres! I may even re-read `The Lord of the
Rings <https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33.The_Lord_of_the_Rings>`__
again. :)
