Some people reported dependency errors when using one of the two .deb
packages I announced today. Turns out it was due to **python-sqlite2**
and **python-image**\ â€¦ Our own `Luiz
Armesto <https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LuizArmesto>`__ has whipped up a newer
package that can be downloaded
`here <http://www.gnulinuxbrasil.org/downloads/billreminder_0.3.0-svn446-1_all.deb>`__,
now with all the right dependencies. Thanks to **Diogo Autilio** and
**Alex Bevilacqua** again for sending me his packages as well (see
comments)!

**UPDATE**: Just as I was about to submit this post, **Diogo** sent me a
`newer <http://www.gnulinuxbrasil.org/downloads/billreminder_0.3-svn453_i386.deb>`__
package with updates up to this second! Wow!
