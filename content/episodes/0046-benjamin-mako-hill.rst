It’s official!!! I have arranged for `Benjamin Mako
Hill <http://mako.yukidoke.org/>`__, Debian and Ubuntu Linux package
maintaner/contributer, to attend our next `Northern New Jersey
Meetup <http://linux.meetup.com/8/>`__ meeting this Monday 11th, 2005! I
have asked him to talk about `Ubuntu <http://www.ubuntulinux.org>`__
Linux and also his involvement with `Debian <http://www.debian.org>`__.
This should be a very interesting meeting for everyone and I urge
everyone to show up! Make sure to
`reserve <http://linux.meetup.com/8/>`__ your spot so I have a good idea
of how many people will be present. Right now I am thinking of meeting
at the front of the store (Panera Bread, Route 4 West Paramus, NJ @ 7pm)
where there are some couches and lots of plugs! If the number of people
reserving increases, I’ll try to reserve the conference room!
