Very cool
`news <http://mail.gnome.org/archives/epiphany-list/2008-April/msg00000.html>`__
from the land of the `Epiphany <http://live.gnome.org/Epiphany>`__ web
browser this morning. Their decision to go with WebKit plus the
synchronization with GNOMEâ€™s release cycle should appeal to a lot of new
developers and contributors! If we could finally get `Firebug for
Epiphany <http://live.gnome.org/action/diff/SummerOfCode2008/Ideas>`__
(this GSoC idea needs a mentor!!!) I could stop using two different
browsers. :)
