`BillReminder <http://billreminder.gnulinuxbrasil.org/>`__ now has
**inline searching** and **colored categories** for (hopefully) easier
sorting and some bling. :) A few more issues have been closed as well,
bringing us closer and closer to a code freeze.

|Inline searching and colored categories|

Also, thanks to **Diogo Autilio** and **Alex Bevilacqua** we now have
BillReminder packaged for **Ubuntu Gutsy**! Please take
`them <http://www.gnulinuxbrasil.org/downloads/>`__ (there are 2 \*.debs
available) for a spin and relate any bugs or feature requests
`here <https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=161428>`__.
