Unfortunately the match between Brazil and Argentina was not broadcasted
here in the United States (well, at least not here where I live). Out of
nowhere my dad calls me from NY to tell me he had just seen this guy
plug the TV in his pub to the net to watch the game. I quickly wrote
down the url to the site:

The feed wasn’t the greatest (quality-wise) from the Peruvian TV, but
for those who really wanted to watch the game it was bliss! After
several minutes the feed was blocked (apparently due to some legal BS)…
but someone quickly created a new feed and off we went! For those
reading this post in time for the second half, the direct url is:
