So last night’s post brought me quite a few replies, and I thank you all
for taking the time to give me the feedback. I hope to find some time
and work on the preferences dialog for BillReminder soon!

On the other front, I received a nice little present from the
`Openbox <http://www.icculus.org/openbox>`__ guys: a way to inspect and
honor files found in /etc/xdg/autostart by default when starting
Openbox. Now, I cannot claim that this is a done deal but I’m keeping my
fingers crossed! :)
