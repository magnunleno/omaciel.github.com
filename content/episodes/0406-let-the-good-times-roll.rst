Just a quick note since I still have no internet at home and have been
busy trying to catch up at my new job:

-  North Carolina rocks!!!
-  Gorgeous weather!
-  **NO TRAFFIC JAMS**!
-  Eastern Carolina BBQ is awsome!
-  Python all day long is what the doctor recommended!
-  The rPath crew know how to make one feel at home! ;)
-  `Jamocha <http://www.goodberrys.com/html/goodberry_s_flavor_of_the_day.html>`__!!!
-  Fresh ground coffee!!!
-  Got
   `sponsored <https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuDeveloperSummitMountainView/Attendees>`__
   to go to the `Ubuntu Developer
   Summit <https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuDeveloperSummitMountainView>`__
   in Mountain View, CA!!!

Hopefully, Iâ€™ll have some pictures loaded (and internet acess) by next
week.

**Note**: When was the last time you saw me use so many exclamation
marks before? ;)
