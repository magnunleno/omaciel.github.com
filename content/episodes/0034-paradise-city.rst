Found a couple of pretty usefull and cool
`Gnome <http://www.gnome.org>`__ applets for my laptop over the weekend:
`netapplet <http://support.novell.com/techcenter/articles/tp10007.html>`__
and `gnome-blog <http://www.gnome.org/~seth/gnome-blog/>`__. Netapplet
allows me to store multiple settings for different wifi access points
for easy switching while on the road. Very usefull and easy to do!
Gnome-blog is supposed to allow you to write a post to your blog without
accessing the web interface. I say “supposed” because I’m yet to try it.
The web site claims that it is `WordPress <http://www.wordpress.org>`__
compatible so it should be ok. It also allows you to spell check and
upload pictures (for those web blogs that supports it) via drag’n’drop.
Maybe I’ll post a screenie later tonight.
