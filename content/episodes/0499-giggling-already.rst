Hey `Sven <http://herzi.eu/comment.php?type=trackback&entry_id=121>`__;

Just a heads upâ€¦ Giggle was
`packaged <http://www.rpath.com/rbuilder/repos/foresight/troveInfo?t=giggle;v=%2Fforesight.rpath.org%40fl%3A1-contrib%2F0.1-2-1>`__
the very say day it was announced for Foresight and rPath Linux. :)

BTW, I could not post a comment in your blog. Someone translated the
messages for me and it seems to be complaining about the Reply field?
