Managed to install Ubuntu 5.10 (Breezy Badger) on my laptop last night!
Very impressive, including the fact that I didnâ€™t have to manually
download the driver and firmware for my ipw2200 wifi card!!! And just
take a look at the ultra sexy notification message on the upper right
hand corner of the screen!!! After adding more repositories to my
source.list, I proceeded to install Banshee and Gajim! F-Spot will be
joining them next!
