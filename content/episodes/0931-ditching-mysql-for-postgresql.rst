In order to better follow what the
`Transifex <http://www.transifex.org>`__ guys are doing with their
development and deployment of
`Transifex.net <http://www.transifex.net/>`__, I have finally made the
switch from **MySQL** to `PostgreSQL <http://www.postgresql.org/>`__ for
the `Transifex
Appliance <https://www.rpath.org/ui/#/appliances?id=https://www.rpath.org/api/products/transifex>`__.
Luckly I was able to corral **diegobz** during my lunch break and
together we worked out the necessary changes to get things to work (and
caught and fixed a minor issue along the way too!).

In the meantime, the appliance seems to be getting some nice and steady
traffic, which I suspect will only increase, specially when a new
version of **Transifex** hits the streets.
