I’ve been known to drink “socially” a few beers here and there but I
must confess that I don’t really know much about the subject. I often
rely on my taste buds OR how warm the weather is and how cold the beer
is. But alas! I have just found this great
`site <http://www.beeradvocate.com/>`__ which will tell you all about
pretty much any beer out there along with usefull reviews and
definitions. So if you don’t know the difference between a
`Schwarzbier <http://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/style/31/>`__, a
`Pilsener <http://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/style/41/>`__, and a
`Stout <http://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/style/158/>`__, then your
problems are now over.
