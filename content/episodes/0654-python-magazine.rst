As pointed out by `Jonathan
Carter <http://jonathancarter.co.za/python-magazine>`__, the first issue
of `Python Magazine <http://www.pythonmagazine.com/c/issue/2007/10>`__
has been published and can be freely downloaded. I took a fairly quick
glimpse at the articles and was very pleased with the amount of (sample)
code included! I would definitely pay for its subscription and have
added it to my (short) list of things Iâ€™d like to have (but cannot
afford to at the moment). My other item in this list? A subscription to
the awesome `Linux Format <http://www.linuxformat.co.uk/>`__ magazine!
