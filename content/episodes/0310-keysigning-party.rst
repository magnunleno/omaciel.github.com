`David Harding <http://gnuisance.net/blog/>`__ is organizing a
`keysigning party <http://gnuisance.net/blog/2006/May/13#gpgwisdom.1>`__
for this June 14th, right after the `LUG/IP <http://lugip.org/>`__
meeting.Ã‚Â  I’m not sure I’ll be able to attend it, but I’ll definitely
try my best!Ã‚Â  I do have some friends in the Princenton area and could
use this chance to meet them over *coff*\ Ã‚Â  coffee *coff*.Ã‚Â  :)

On a different note, this blog is now syndicated at
`GnuJersey.org <http://gnujersey.org/>`__.Ã‚Â  I just love the Ubuntu
and RHCE badges next to my posts!Ã‚Â  ;)
