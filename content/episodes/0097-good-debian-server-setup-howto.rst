Earlier this year `OSNews <http://www.osnews.com>`__ published my
`article <http://www.ogmaciel.com/?page_id=101>`__ titled *"Installing
Debian Linux For The Faint Of Heart."* Today I came across `another
article <http://www.harrysufehmi.com/phpwiki/index.php/SettingUpLinuxServer>`__
dealing with the same subject. Now, I know people have hammered these
types of articles to death in the net but this one sounded worth the
risk of mentioning. For one thing, it covers hardening your bare-bones
`Debian <http://www.debian.org>`__ server which, IMHO should be worth
looking at no matter what.
