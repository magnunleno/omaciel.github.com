My `previous <http://www.ogmaciel.com/?p=100>`__ post talked about how
our lives are getting registered in the internet, free for everyone and
anyone to see. Today I learned about `this
site <http://postsecret.blogspot.com/>`__ which has only strengthened my
“thesis.”

    *"is an ongoing community art project where people mail-in their
    secrets anonymously on one side of a homemade postcard."*

Some of these so called postcards are the scariest things I’ve seen
online in quite some time… Rather disturbing…
