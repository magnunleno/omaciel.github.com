Hereâ€™s what happened this week:

#. `Quotes to brighten your day <http://../?p=886>`__

   -  Kind of ironic how my post titled â€œStop whining and improve your
      lifeâ€? attracted so much negativity in the comments area.

#. `From the â€œUseful Django Tipâ€? Department: Reset The Admin
   Password <http://../?p=927>`__

   -  This comes straight from the Useful Django Tip department: How do
      you reset the admin password for a Django project when youâ€™ve
      forgotten it?

#. `Helping downstream translations swim upstream: Part
   1 <http://../?p=909>`__

   -  Sometimes, contributing back to upstream open source projects is
      not as straight forward as one may think. â€œHelping downstream
      translations swim upstreamâ€? will be a new series of articles
      where I intend to explain the issues contributors may face when
      attempting to send translations back to upstream projects, and
      hopefully, devise a couple of possible solutions.

#. `Help sponsor Mercurial development! <http://../?p=944>`__

   -  Anyone who has ever added a project to BitBucket already knows
      what Mercurial is, but for those who have never heard about it…

#. `Transifex adds new features, wins more hearts <http://../?p=947>`__

   -  It has been a great Spring for Transifex.net, everyoneâ€™s
      favorite open source translation portal!

#. `Book Preview: Django 1.1 Testing and Debugging <http://../?p=949>`__

   -  What a great day to kick of the day! Just received my
      complimentary copy of the book â€œDjango 1.1 Testing and
      Debuggingâ€? from Packt Publishing!
