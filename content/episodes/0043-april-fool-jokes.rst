Ha! `Planet Gnome <http://planet.gnome.org>`__ and `Planet
KDE <http://www.planetkde.org>`__ have played their April Fools trick on
me today. Apparently theyâ€™ve switched their DNS entries (or whatever it
is that is required) so that people visiting Planet Gnome will be
directed to Planet KDE (but the URL still says planet.gnome.org) and
vice-versa! I refreshed my page a couple of times untill I realized what
had happened! Good one guys!

**Update:** Just noticed that `Planet
Debian <http://planet.debian.org/>`__ has changed their Debian logo for
an `Ubuntu <http://www.ubuntulinux.org/>`__'s.
