At last, after a long hiatus, I can shout out for the whole world to
hear: `Foresight Linux 2.5.0 <http://wp.me/pEMZT-bN>`__ is out and
about! This is our first official release in almost 2 years
(`2.1.1 <http://distrowatch.com/5480>`__ was released May 15th, 2009!!!)
and it is filled to the brim with the very latest stable applications
out there!

A lot of work, sweat, and tears by a lot of different people went into
getting this release out the door, and to all of you out there who stood
by us through thick and thin, I thank you and salute you! Foresight
Linux was the **first Linux distribution to have a rolling release
schedule** and bring all the coolest new applications to your desktop!
Expect to hear a lot from us from now on… **Because your distro should
be cool**!
