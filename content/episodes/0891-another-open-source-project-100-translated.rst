Thanks to the incredible work of **Henrique P. Machado**, Brazilian
Portuguese speaking open source users will now be able to run **LXDE**
completely `translated <http://pootle.lxde.bsnet.se/pt_BR/lxde/>`__!
Yeah, another 100% Brazilian Portuguese translation available! I will
spend the next few days making sure everything is following the same
guidelines weâ€™ve used for **GNOME** and **Xfce**, so if you speak the
language and got time to review/send sugestions, your help will be
appreciated. :)
