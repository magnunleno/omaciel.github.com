I didn’t know you could do all of these with rss!!! Wow!!! Read the
original post `here <http://timyang.com/comments.php?id=630_0_1_0_C>`__.

Get the news as it happens from multiple news sources
   An RSS feed reader is an aggregator of numerous feeds from news
   sources (and nearly every major paper and TV news network has RSS
   feeds today). But now there are even feeds that aggregate other
   feeds. The new `RSSmix.com <http://rssmix.com/>`__ lets you combine
   all the news source RSS feeds into one single feed so you get news as
   it happens.

Collect your email from all your email accounts in your RSS reader
   Easily done with `mailbucket.org <http://www.mailbucket.org/>`__. And
   each `Gmail account has an RSS
   feed <http://forevergeek.com/geek_resources/gmail_rss_feed.php>`__
   too. Or if you’re a user of
   `Mailinator.com <http://mailinator.com/>`__, then you’ll be glad
   there’s a similar service called
   `dodgeit.com <http://dodgeit.com/>`__ but with RSS feeds.

Track Fedex packages
   `Ben Hammersley
   says <http://www.benhammersley.com/tools/fedex_package_tracking_in_rss.html>`__
   Just add your tracking number to the end of a special RSS feed
   address.

Get notified of bargains at Ebay
   `RSSauction.com <http://www.rssauction.com/>`__ lets you specify the
   type of product, its description and even the price range in their
   customised Ebay feeds.

Get stock updates
   There have been various paid services and limited unpaid ticker
   services around. `Tim Bray made a customisable
   feed <http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/04/27/RSSticker>`__.
   Yahoo is introducing its own `RSS ticker
   service <http://ticker.yahoo.com/>`__.

Get the weather reports
   `Weather Underground <http://www.wunderground.com/>`__ has the
   weather of every city and town in the world. And each of them now has
   an RSS feed. Alternatively, there is
   `RSSweather.com <http://www.rssweather.com/>`__.

Find out what people are saying about you, your company or your product online
   Services like `technorati.com <http://technorati.com>`__ and
   `pubsub.com <http://pubsub.com/>`__ offer something that’s popularly
   called persistent search delivery. You type in a search term such as
   your name and or your company name or product name and they will
   return the newest indexed references to you in a customised RSS feed.
   Both services scan blogs. If you want persistent search delivery from
   a broader range of sites, you have
   `Googlealert.com <http://www.googlealert.com/>`__.

Get music, radio programs and TV clips
   Now you have podcasts and directories like
   `podcastalley.com <http://www.podcastalley.com/>`__ that also serve
   the latest podcasts in several RSS feeds. And increasingly, like
   `Comedy Central’s Daily
   Show <http://www.comedycentral.com/mp/browsevideos.jhtml?s=ds>`__,
   broadcasters are finding it effective to promote and deliver their
   shows in RSS. Videobloggers now have a community website called
   `Mcfeedia.com <http://mefeedia.com/>`__ that adds tags to video blog
   RSS feeds.

Stay updated on someone’s schedule
   `RSScalendar.com <http://rsscalendar.com/>`__ lets someone input new
   events and meetings on their schedule for free. And if you pick up
   the RSS feed for that schedule, you’re always up-to-date on what’s
   going on in that person’s day.

Get cinema schedule updates
   Quietly getting popular, a movement led by small local cinemas like
   `City Cinema <http://www.citycinema.net/>`__, rather than big cinema
   networks. But the bigger cinemas are delivering updates via email and
   these can be converted into feeds by mailbucket.org.

Read your favourite comics
   Many daily and weekly comic authors publish online and have an RSS
   feed. `Dilbert <http://dilbert.com/>`__ of course has one. Best way
   to locate the feed is to type in the name of the comic into either
   `Feedster.com <http://feedster.com/>`__ or
   `Bloglines.com <http://bloglines.com/>`__ (both are great RSS feed
   directories). And even if your favourite comic doesn’t have a feed on
   its website, a good comic will have someone somewhere creating an
   unofficial scraped feed.
   `Comicalert.com <http://www.comicalert.com/>`__ has a large updated
   list of both official and unofficial RSS feed list of hundreds of
   comics.

Find out what other people surfing
   I don’t mean spyware. A lot of people use online bookmarks which they
   make public. Places like `del.icio.us <http://del.icio.us/>`__,
   `feedmarker.com <http://feedmarker.com/>`__,
   `furl.net <http://furl.net/>`__ and the new
   `wists.com <http://wists.com/>`__ are online bookmark services that
   create RSS feeds for each user.

Automatically backup your weblog posts
   If your RSS feed is being picked up by an online feed reader service
   like `Bloglines.com <http://bloglines.com/>`__, they will store all
   your entries on their server. Unfortunately, they don’t have an
   export feature. But at least all your entries (if you have full
   entries in your RSS feed) are safe and dated.

Get software updates
   Popular software downloads sites like
   `Download.com <http://download.com/>`__ and
   `versiontracker.com <http://versiontracker.com/>`__ let you keep up
   with all new releases via RSS. So you can also be alerted when your
   favourite softwares have a new version or when there are better
   releases.

Get the latest bittorrent files and ahem, p\*rn
   As they say, if its worth something, it’s worth more illegal.
   Bittorrent directory `Torrentspy.com <http://torrentspy.com/>`__ was
   the first to have an RSS feed that lets its users know what has just
   been uploaded. And the online p\*rn industry, being always on the
   cutting edge of online business, was probably the first to take to
   blog CMSes and use them to generate traffic through RSS feeds. I’ll
   refrain from linking to one here, but it just takes a Google search
   to find several.
