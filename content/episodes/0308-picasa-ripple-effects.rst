Today’s Google’s announcement of a Linux supported version of their
`Picasa <http://picasa.google.com/linux/>`__ product sent some ripple
efects through the Open Source community pond… This
`article <http://rlove.org/log/2006052601>`__ shows some interisting
different ways people reacted to it, from the “holy cow, this is so cool
Batman!” to the “… but they’re using Wine for this?” comments.

I particularly went through a roller coaster of emotions myself, going
through several different “stages” as wave after wave of the news came
up in my RSS Reader. Deep down I wish it had been a complete port… Not
too sure why, but I have this unexplained need for native applications
running on my computers, even if someone can prove to me that any
permance issues are negligent. But at the end of the roller coaster
“ride”, I started to wonder if this wouldn’t be a means to bring in
(i.e. pseudo-port) other new applications over to linux faster? And when
you consider the great variety of Open Source applications out there,
would people for instance stop using the Gimp is one day Macrobe
(Macromedia+Adobe) were to create a Wined version of Photoshop???

I wonder what kind of replies I’m going to get…
