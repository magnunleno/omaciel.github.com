if someone were to take a peek at the books I’ve been reading lately,
he/she/it could assume the following:

|books|

-  I like to read about history;
-  I’m trying to learn to program in Python (was influenced by
   `lucasds <http://lucasd.wordpress.com/>`__);
-  I keep some reference material for those moments when Google is not
   enough;
