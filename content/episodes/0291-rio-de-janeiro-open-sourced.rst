A new legislation
(`http://www.softwarelivre.org/news/6524 <http://www.softwarelivre.org/news/6524>`__
in pt\_BR) has been approved in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, by which the
entire local goverment institutions will have to give priority to Open
Source solutions!Ã‚Â  Hopefully the rest of the nation will follow soon
and make better use of all that money currently being spent on licenses
and what not…Ã‚Â  How about putting an end to poverty and illiteracy in
one of the largest countries in the world???
