I need your help to get
`BillReminder <http://billreminder.gnulinuxbrasil.org/>`__ translated
into as many different languages as possible! Up until now I have relied
on a list of collaborators who know how to work with a message catalog
template (i.e. pot file) and use it to generate a translated message
file (i.e. po file). I’m aware that a lot of people probably don’t know
what I’m talking about and/or may feel uneasy about working with text
files and what not… so I decided to set
`BillReminder <http://billreminder.gnulinuxbrasil.org/>`__ up for
translation via `Rosetta <https://translations.launchpad.net>`__, which
can be reached
`here <https://translations.launchpad.net/billreminder>`__.

|BillReminder can now be translated via Rosetta|

Once you have registered to use Rosetta, and you are part of one of the
many translation
`teams <https://translations.launchpad.net/+groups/ubuntu-translators>`__,
it should be extremely
`easy <https://translations.launchpad.net/+about>`__ for you to help out
with the translation effort. I’m looking forward to seeing new languages
added to the project just in time for an upcoming release.
