    I’ve heard that when the RedHat developers present new open-source
    packages to their local Linux User-Group, before the meeting is over
    one of the **Foresight** people will have downloaded the source,
    **created a Foresight package, uploaded it to the repository for
    folks to get, and it will be available for anyone to use**. It’s
    explicitly designed as a package management system with very little
    overhead to creating new packages.
