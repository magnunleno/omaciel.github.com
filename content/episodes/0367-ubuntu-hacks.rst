I still have a few copies of `Ubuntu
Hacks <http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/ubuntuhks/>`__ left from the batch
I received from O’Reilly.Ã‚Â  If you live around New York City and don’t
mind driving/walking/biking to Fort Lee, NJ (right across the George
Washington Bridge), I could give it to you.Ã‚Â  The plan was to give
them together with the new Dapper CDs, but unfortunately mine are taking
longer to arrive.

Anyhow, we could meet at the local StarBucks store and chit-chat while
getting caffeinated.Ã‚Â  :)
