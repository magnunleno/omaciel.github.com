For those who follow my many different projects and enterprises, you
probably already know that I have been hosting a podcast called
`Castálio Podcast <http://www.castalio.info/>`__, a bi-weekly show where
I interview people from the **Brazilian FOSS** world and talk about
their likes, dislikes and what events and factors shaped their lives!

When I asked my listeners if they would be interested in an episode in
English with someone new and exciting, the answer was an overwhelming
‘\ **Yes**!’

So for my very first episode in English I chose to interview a good
friend of mine from several years: \ **Pete Savage**! During the next 58
minutes we talked about how we first met through a \ **PyGtk** video he
posted a while back during a \ **Linux User Group**\ meeting, how he
first got involved with \ **Edubuntu**, and then moved on to several
other projects such as \ **ProgBox** and **GeekDeck**, about the books
that he’s written including the reason for writing “\ **Emblem
Divide**\ ”, how much the \ **Japanese culture** plays a role in his
daily life, and his \ **Top 5** movies, books and movies! While the
episodes’ in English future are yet to be determined, this latest
episode can be downloaded
