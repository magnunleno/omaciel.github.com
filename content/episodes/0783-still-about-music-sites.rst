I came across `Global Pandora <http://globalpandora.com/>`__ after
checking out the anonymous tip left on my previous post. Apparently it
is a site that explains how you can gain access to the services provided
by `Pandora <http://pandora.com>`__ in case you live outside the United
States. I was not aware of this, but due to some legal mambo jambo,
Pandora is only available in the US, which is a shame!

Since I do live in the United States, I didn’t try out the tip, but took
the time to check out some of the other music sites listed on **Global
Pandora**. The one the attracted my attention was
`AnywhereFM <http://www.anywhere.fm/player/>`__ for its claim that you
can upload your entire musical collection to their servers and listen to
it from anywhere!

There’s also the option to create your own personalized “radio station”
and share it with anyone. I haven’t tried it yet but will give it a spin
some time later this weekend.
