Just added a few more links to some of my favorite sites, visited
**every** single day, **religiously**! Where are Slashdot or OSNews you
may ask? I have become extremelly disappointed with the quality and
(lack of) variety of their articles. If you donâ€™t feel like looking
through the old list of links and try to figure out which ones are the
new ones, here they are:

#. `Planet Debian <http://planet.debian.org/>`__
#. `Planet Security <http://planetsecurity.bacarospo.net/>`__
#. `Planet Ubuntu <http://planet.ubuntulinux.org/>`__

Some bloggers subscribe to multiple aggregators but you should have a
lot of good material to read during your morning hours.
