Just wanted to tease you guys out there about a new feature that the
`Transifex <http://www.transifex.org>`__ guys are working on these days:
**Translation Reviews**! Have you ever wandered if your translations
conform to the standard vocabulary that your team uses? Have you ever
wanted someone to take a look at what you’ve done before sending in your
final work for commit approval?

Now, mind you this is still very alpha code but that is probably a good
thing since you can play with it and give your feedback on how to
improve it. As always, you can get this in an easy to consume format by
using the `Transifex Appliance <http://bit.ly/Transifex>`__ Developer
edition… or you can join the `Xfce <https://translations.xfce.org/>`__
translators who are already enjoying Transifex latest code! :)
