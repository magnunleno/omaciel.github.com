Congratulations to the entire `Foresight
Linux <http://www.foresightlinux.org>`__ team for releasing their
version 1.3, timed to be released with **GNOME 2.18.2**!!!

Some of the new features are:

|image0|\ **GNOME**: This is the third Foresight Linux release with
GNOME 2.18 (after 2.18.0 & 2.18.1), and contains minor fixes and
improvements.

|image1|\ **Desktop Search**: With **Beagle** 0.2.17 and tweaked for
Foresight Linux, we continue to improve the ability to search your
computer.

|image2|\ **Web browsing**: We have upgraded **Epiphany** web browser to
version 2.18.2.

|image3|\ **First Boot Process**: The outdated **Firstboot** mechanism
has been replaced by our modified version of autoconfig from Knoppix to
configure X.Org, and creating the first user is done by **Firstrun**.
This will make it even easier for users to install Foresight.

|image4|\ **Chat**: â€¦ with **Pidgin** (formerly known as GAIM) updated
to version 2.0.1. Pidgin supports multiple chat protocols such as
Jabber, MSN, AIM, ICQ, IRC and more.

|image5|\ **HAL**: was updated to 0.5.9. HAL, the Hardware Abstraction
Layer, has updates for a number of devices. This should make Foresight
compatible with more peripherals.

|image6|\ **X.Org 7.2**: The new graphical server makes it easier for
users by automatically installing monitors and video cards without
editing configuration files.

|image7| The latest **Compiz** 3D window manager, installed by default
on Foresight Linux

|image8|\ **Package Manager**: The **Conary** package manager has been
updated to the latest version, 1.2.27. Conary is a full featured
distributed package manager similar to RPM or dpkg, featuring the
ability to install software, manage dependencies and even rollback to
previously installed versions.
