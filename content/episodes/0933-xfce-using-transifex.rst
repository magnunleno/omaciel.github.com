In case you’ve missed it, the `Xfce <http://www.xfce.org>`__ project has
been using their own installation of
`Transifex <http://www.transifex.org>`__ to manage their translations
online! Translators can now visit
`http://translations.xfce.org <http://translations.xfce.org>`__ and keep
up with the action!

I’ve been contributing with translations for the **Brazilian
Portuguese** language for quite some time now, and have been a strong
supporter for the **Transifex** project as well, so I was thrilled to
learn they were “working together”! But there is a second reason why I’m
mentioning this on my blog:

Turns out that **Nick Schermer**, maintainer for
`http://translations.xfce.org <http://translations.xfce.org/>`__, is
using my `Transifex
appliance <https://www.rpath.org/ui/#/appliances?id=https://www.rpath.org/api/products/transifex>`__
too!!! Moreover, he chose to use the appliance built from the
development branch to get the very latest bits being committed to the
development branch of Transifex. It has been a **win-win-win** (yes, 3
times!) relationship so far for all parties involved, for:

-  Xfce gets a ready to run, batteries included, Transifex appliance
   with all the latest and coolest features without having to build
   things by hand.
-  Transifex gets tons of excellent feedback for this version still in
   development and work out all the kinks before the next release.
-  My appliance has also enjoyed of tons of excellent feedback and is
   now more robust and ready for consumption.

Some of the cool features that you can expect from the next version of
**Transifex** (and that the over 200 registered **Xfce** translators are
already enjoying) are:

-  Better support for Lotte, the online translations editor, and the
   removal of the 100-strings limitation;
-  Automatic translation suggestions within Lotte;
-  Support for translation teams;
-  New timeline history for tracking contributors, teams, and projects
   activities;
-  Top Translators “hit list” for your bragging rights ;)

The Transifex Appliance (developer image) has been updated almost on a
daily basis, so those out there already using it can keep it updated
using the web based appliance management tool or running conary
updateall. As always, you can expect a stable release the very same day
that Transifex releases the upcoming 0.8 version! I’d love to hear from
all of you appliance users out there. Just drop me a line or a comment
here and I’ll do my best to improve your experience.
